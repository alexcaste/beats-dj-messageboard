  <p>
    Beats is where you get to boast, complain or just blabber nonsensically about DJ's and everythign else EDM related.  Hated the way the DJ looked at you or that he didn't play a track from your iPod - post it on Beats.  Rolled so hard that you loved every song and woke up in a strangers' car - talk about it on Beats.  Think EDM stands for Eat D**k Meat then Beats is the place for you.  On the Beats message board like minded people from across the world come to troll each other in anonymity.  Beats generic non-exclusive technology does not match you to someone you will become life long friends with.  Instead, Beats is simply a message board written in JavaScript using Ember framework and a Firebase database.  So, if you are looking for a place to be yourself - well, heh, you're on the internet so don't bother - but if you're looking for a random place to post things barely realted to electronic dance music then Beats is the place for you.  Find your community, find your passion, find yourself on Beats.

    Oh and just to fill the page here's two more paragraphs of random filler.  I would give you a lollipop for figuring out what it is from but - it's the internet so...NO SOUP FOR YOU!  Begin filler: Man's gotta know his limitations. when a naked man's chasing a woman through an alley with a butcher knife and a hard-on, i figure he's not out collecting for the red cross. you want a guarantee, buy a toaster. this is the ak-47 assault rifle, the preferred weapon of your enemy; and it makes a distinctive sound when fired at you, so remember it. are you feeling lucky punk ever notice how sometimes you come across somebody you shouldn't have f**ked with? well, i'm that guy. dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy. don't p!ss down my back and tell me it's raining. you see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig. you dig. well, do you have anything to say for yourself? what you have to ask yourself is, do i feel lucky. well do ya' punk? this is my gun, clyde!

    Mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. bruce... i'm god. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. well, what is it today? more spelunking? cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd.
